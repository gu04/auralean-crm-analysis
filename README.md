# Project Background

Auralean Apparel, founded in 2013, is a global retailer specialising in high-quality garments, accessories, and lifestyle products. Operating through both flagship stores and a dynamic e-commerce platform, Auralean Apparel has developed a loyal customer base across various regions worldwide. The brand?s marketing strategy combines seasonal campaigns and loyalty rewards to solidify its luxury positioning.

Over the years, Auralean has accumulated extensive data on customers, their purchases, and key performances of its diverse marketing campaigns. Nonetheless, much of the data?s potential has not been thoroughly utilised and investigated for analytical insights to drive strategic decisions for Auralean?s improved profitability and customer spending.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Marketing Channel Performance
  Evaluation on campaign conversion efficiency and ROI (Return on Investment) across App, Email, and SMS marketing channels, identifying top- and under-performing campaigns for targeted investment and financial optimisation.
- Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)
  Analysis of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary areas to determine customer profiles that generate the highest conversion count, suggesting strategies to raise customer retention, reactivation, and upselling.
- Loyalty Tier Effectiveness
  Assessment of customer spending behaviours, conversion rates, and customer base distribution across the company?s loyal tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) to enhance tier benefits and encourage tier progressions.
